# Sign Shops

Create a sign shop Please note! This guide is also available as a video clip.

Materials Selling items through shops is a convenient way to get rid of things you don't need and earn euros at the same time. To create a shop, you will need four things:

A chest A redstone A sign Something to sell To make it simple, let's take an example where we create a shop that sells diamonds for 250 euros each, and where the shop's total stock is 64 diamonds (one stack).

#### Step 1: Place the chest&#x20;

Start by placing the chest somewhere on a plot you own. The chest must be locked in order to be connected to a sign, which it becomes automatically when you place it. What you need to do next is to place the item you want to sell in the chest, in this example a diamond. So, place a diamond in the chest, so that you have 63 left in your inventory and only one in your chest.

#### Step 2: Place the sign

&#x20;Now place the sign where you want people to be able to shop. The sign does not need to be next to the chest, it can be a few blocks away (max 48 blocks X/Z, any Y), if desired. On the sign's four lines, write:

BUY any text any text 250 ...to create a shop where customers can buy items for 250 euros. Instead of "any text," you can write something about what the shop sells, for example, "Excellent diamonds at a great price."

#### Step 3: Connect the sign to the chest

&#x20;To connect the sign to the chest, make sure you have redstone in hand. Once you have it, right-click once on the sign and then once on the chest.

#### Step 4: Restock the shop

&#x20;If everything went well, you should now have a shop that sells a diamond for 250 euros. You can then restock the shop's inventory by placing the remaining 63 diamonds in the chest.
