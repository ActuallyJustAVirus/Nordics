# Vote for the server - get payed

If you want to help Nordics, you are welcome to go to planetminecraft.com/nordics and vote for the server. By doing so, you contribute to making Nordics grow, as the server will rank higher in the server list on planetminecraft

You can vote once a day for the server. For each vote you cast, you will receive 25 euro as a thank you, or 40 if you are a patreon member. This means that you can get approximately 30,000 euro every month (60,000 if you are a patron), just by voting for the server!

#### If it doesn't work,

&#x20;Unfortunately, you can only vote once a day from the same IP.

#### Delayed reward distribution&#x20;

Sometimes you may successfully vote for the server but still not receive any rewards. This can happen, for example, if you vote when the server is being restarted. If this occurs, you will receive your reward within a day, at 5:00 AM, provided that the server is running at that time.
