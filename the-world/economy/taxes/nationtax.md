# Nationtax

Towns pay 4 euros per chunk and a day in tax to the nation. This means it costs 4 euros in tax per chunk acquired using /town claim or /town buy outpost.

The tax that towns pay to the nation is called nation tax(as opposed to the town above tax), and this tax is deducted from each town after the town has collected town tax from its members, according to the principles above. State tax is based solely on how many chunks the town has when collecting taxes.

If one wants to reduce the state tax in a town, one can remove chunks from the town using the command /town unclaim.
