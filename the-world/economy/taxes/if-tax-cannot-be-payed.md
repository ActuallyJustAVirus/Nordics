# If tax cannot be payed

Different things happen depending on whether it is a player who cannot pay town tax to towns or a town that cannot pay nation tax to the nation.

#### For players

&#x20;Since players pay taxes proportionally to how much they have in their wallet, it is impossible to "not be able to pay" their tax. The worst thing that can happen is having nothing in the wallet, i.e., 0 euros. If the town tax is 5 percent, it becomes 5 percent of 0, and one then pays 0 (nothing) in tax. Some towns can exclude members who do not pay any tax, but this happens manually. No matter how little tax one pays, one does not automatically lose either town membership or plot ownership.

#### For towns

Here it is a little worse. Since the tax for towns is based on the size of land areas the towns own, a town may find itself in a situation where it is required to pay more euros in tax than the town has in the town treasury. If this were to occur, the town would go under.

When a town goes under, one of the following two things happens:

**Small town:** If the town owns fewer than 25 chunks and at the same time has fewer than 20 members, it will be removed. The plots are removed, the protection over the townland disappears, and the town ceases to exist entirely.

**Big town:** If the town has at least 25 chunks or at least 20 members, the town becomes a nature reserve. The implications can be found under the Nature Reserve page in the menu.
