# Taxes

A significant part of the economic system relies on players and towns paying taxes to ensure the financial sustainability of the state and all individual cities. The tax consists of a sum of euros that city members pay to their towns, and another sum that cities pay to the state. The payment occurs once per day at midnight, and it all happens completely automatically. Therefore, there is no need to do anything special to pay your taxes.

The taxes can be seen as a flow where the euros go as follows: city members → towns → nation

Refer to the two subpages for information about taxes for players (town tax) and taxes for cities (nation tax).
