# Euro - the virtual currency

On Nordics, there is a virtual currency called Euro. The fact that the currency is virtual means that it only exists and operates within Nordics. It cannot be used outside of Nordics, and it is also not possible to buy or sell Euro for real money. When logging into the server for the first time, one receives 1,000 Euros as initial capital. This hopefully provides enough to purchase a first plot in a city to settle in, but it probably won't be enough for much more.

To see how much Euro one or someone else has, the command `/balance` can be used.

#### Ways to Wealth

There are many different ways to earn Euro, and often it's only imagination (and the rules!) that sets the limits for the methods one can use to increase their wealth. Most ways to earn Euro involve trade, either with other players or with the state. Below is a list of examples of how to earn Euro:

* Sell items to the state in the Gallery (/go gallery).&#x20;
* Sell items to other players.
* Work for another player or for a city.&#x20;
* Vote on the server - a quick way to get 1,000 Euros daily (2,000 if you are a VIP). [`Read more`](vote-for-the-server-get-payed.md)
* Participate, and win in competitions.

Please note that the list above is only examples, and there are probably other ways to earn euros that are not mentioned in the list.

#### Things one must pay for&#x20;

When playing on Nordics, one can of course choose whether to, for example, buy things from other players or not. If one is short of Euro, it may be a good idea to refrain from buying anything, especially if saving up for something expensive. However, there are some things that one generally has to pay for, whether one wants to or not.

#### Town tax:&#x20;

If one lives in a town, one can assume that they have to pay town tax. It is a sum of euros automatically deducted from one's wallet every midnight and sent to the city's treasury. Even if there are circumstances that mean one does not always pay city tax, one should still assume that they do.

#### Fines and damages:&#x20;

If one commits a rule violation, they may in some cases have to pay fines or damages. Both fines and damages are things one is required to pay, but the purpose differs slightly. Fines are something paid as part of a punishment, and the money goes to the state. Damages are not part of a punishment, but something paid as compensation to one or more players who have been harmed due to the rule violation committed. For example, if one unlawfully kills someone and does not have the items the victim dropped, they may be required to pay damages equivalent to the value of the items.
