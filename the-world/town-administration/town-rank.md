# Town rank

Ranks and Town Leadership In a town, there are a number of predetermined ranks or levels. The number and type of ranks held may vary between towns. In addition to regular members, there are four ranks, each with different rights and duties. The exact chat commands available to each rank are described in the lists under the heading "Chat Commands" in the library's main menu.

### Mayor

There must be at least one to have the town. Can use all commands available for towns. Can appoint all lower ranks0

Tips for new mayors: When you are a mayor, life suddenly feels a bit freer and you may feel a greater power and control. For some, this may mean that other players want to join and will ask or nag for ranks from you and in your town. Before you start handing out ranks, think about who you are giving them to. We have encountered problems several times when being a bit too kind and giving a high rank to an unknown player who promises to help in the town, only to then destroy and steal resources and quickly leave the town.

DO NOT bring in unknown players as Vice Mayor. That rank is for players you actually know or can trust. It doesn't guarantee anything, but it minimizes the chances of you having problems with the town. Also consider who you give assistant rank to. Ranks give players different opportunities in the town, and not all players are there to seriously run the town but are only there to grief or destroy. Avoid being exposed to them by being careful with handing out ranks. The higher the rank, the more cautious you should be.

### Co-Mayor

* The co-mayor has the same commands as the mayor except
  * They cannot delete the town
  * They cannot create a nation
  * They cannot set a new mayor
