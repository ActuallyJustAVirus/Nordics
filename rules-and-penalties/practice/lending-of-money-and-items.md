# Lending of money and items

Lending of money, items, or equipment is not uncommon in Nordics. When lending something, one usually expects to get it back. Sometimes, obstacles arise, resulting in things not being returned. On this page, you can find what applies to Nordics when things don't go as planned. It is also advisable to read this page before deciding to lend anything, as it can be associated with significant risks to lend out one's belongings to someone else.

What should a good agreement for lending items or Minecraft coins contain? Certain things are very important when agreeing. The following things should be written in the text:

* Who is lending out
* Who is borrowing
* What has been lent out
* When the borrowed item should have been returned last

#### Can you receive compensation if the item you lent out is not returned?

&#x20;Kottcraft does not promise to compensate for lent Minecraft coins or items. Therefore, we recommend that players not lend out anything they cannot afford to lose.

#### Must you return something that you have borrowed from another player?

&#x20;Of course, as a player, you must return the items you have borrowed as long as there is a valid agreement. One can be penalized for fraud if one refuses to return borrowed money or items within the agreed time. This also means that a moderator can intervene and seize items/Minecraft coins to the value of what has not been returned. If you have an agreement with another player, it is very important to be careful to keep the promises you have made.
