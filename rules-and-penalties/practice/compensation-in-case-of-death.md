# 6. Compensation in case of death

## Compensation in case of death

&#x20;First and foremost, Nordics is a game world with dangerous parts, and there is often a risk of accidentally dying, depending on where you are. The cause of death varies, but generally, it is one's responsibility for what one does, where one goes, and how one behaves with one player.

### When can you receive compensation?

&#x20;If one's death is classified as non-natural, the general rule is the right to compensation. However, there are exceptions to this, and the moderators make assessments based on the unique circumstances of each situation.

### Natural deaths

A natural death is a death that occurs as a consequence of the ideas behind survival mode in Minecraft. Since Nordics is largely a survival server, there is normally no compensation for deaths of this kind. Natural deaths can, for example, involve being killed by a monster, crashing when gliding with an elytra, falling down a mountain wall, drowning in an ocean, falling into lava, or falling into the end world.

### Non-natural deaths

As the title suggests, these deaths are caused by something not an intended idea in Minecraft's survival mode. Among non-natural deaths, we find, for example, when a player murders another player and deaths caused by technical errors. In the event of a non-natural death, the general rule is the right to compensation for the items lost in connection with the death.

#### When a player murders another player

The principle is that it is not allowed to kill other players. If one kills another player, it is a violation of the rules, and the victim is entitled to compensation for the items lost in connection with the unlawful killing. If the items disappeared or were picked up by someone other than the perpetrator or victim, the perpetrator is still liable for compensation. The compensation can then be paid with, for example, the perpetrator's inventory, ender chest, chests, or wallet. If the perpetrator does not pay full compensation to the victim on their own, a moderator can do so on behalf of the perpetrator. This also applies when a player has acted in self-defence, as the purpose of self-defence is to defend oneself, not to take someone else's belongings.

If one falls as a result of a player intentionally removing the blocks one was standing on, or if one was pushed - it is classified as unlawful killing, and one is then entitled to compensation. However, it is more difficult in terms of evidence than in other cases of unlawful killing, as this is something that happens indirectly.

#### Deaths caused by technical errors

Unfortunately, technical errors occur with the server, resulting in one's death. If this happens, it must be proven, or at least demonstrated, that a technical error on the server has occurred. If proven, compensation is generally paid directly from the state. Examples of technical errors include:

* &#x20;Falling beneath the world for a reason other than falling through a hole in the ground
* Moderators may compensate in case of lag on rare occasions; if one generally has a very bad connection, it is recommended to stay away from danger.

&#x20;The list of examples is not exhaustive. It is also impossible to receive compensation if one falls into the void in the end world or lags due to a slow computer or an unstable internet connection.
