# Communication

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for communication channels.

#### 3.1 Inappropriate language

&#x20;Inappropriate language includes inappropriate topics of conversation. Topics that may be inappropriate on Kottcraft include, for example, politics, religion, tobacco, drugs, and topics of a sexual nature. Where the line is drawn is determined by those who are moderating the chat at the time. Something that may be okay at one time is not automatically okay at another time, and vice versa. If you are unsure whether what you want to write is okay or not, ask a moderator or chat guard for advice. If there is no one to ask and you are unsure, the recommendation is not to bring it up at all.

It is completely okay to talk about things unrelated to Kottcraft. But if it's a private conversation with a friend, it's best to keep it private, for example, in /msg on the server. If it's a private conversation among many parties, there is a function to activate a meeting on the server, or go to a separate room on Discord.

You can be punished if what you write leads others to interpret it as inappropriate.

#### 3.3 Spam&#x20;

Trash messages can include messages that contain extremely many meaningless characters or primarily capital letters. Examples that are not okay are as follows:

* EJGJASDFASLDFKAWELOKFASDKF!!!!"#!"Â¤!"!
* DOES ANYONE waaaaaaaaant a diiiiiiaaaaaaaaamond FOR ONLY 10 MINEMYN!"#!"!
* PLEEEEEASE GIVE ME 10000 MINEMYNt I'M NEW HERE AND I HAVE NO MONEY.

#### 3.4 Marketing offenses

&#x20;Whether something is considered an allowable discussion or prohibited advertising is something the moderators assess in each individual case, but here are a few examples to clarify where the line is drawn.

Permitted discussions. The following lines are examples of what is allowed.

* Oh, have you also played on Menoxia? How fun! I had a city there once, but then the server crashed and it disappeared...
* Kottcraft is the third server I play on; Menoxia was my first and xPlay was my second.
* I have been a moderator on Menoxia. It was an educational experience.
* Kottcraft is great because you can have plots of different sizes, but Menoxia is also great because you can buy moderator ranks there.

Prohibited advertising. The following lines are examples of what is prohibited.

* Write to me in PM if you want to play on my realm.
* Everyone is joining play.menoxia.com! ! !
* Do you want to play on Menoxia? Search the name on the web, you will find it. Welcome!
* We are releasing free ranks on play.menoxia.com in five minutes. Hurry there!

#### 3.5 Unlawful opposition

&#x20;The concept of Constructive criticism: "Constructive criticism usually refers to criticism that is intended to improve the criticized, for example by providing suggestions for change."

To criticize, comment, question both the server, moderators, and more is completely okay. It is through criticism that we develop, and it is very important that we receive this. But criticism must also be done in the right way, otherwise the criticism will not be constructive.
