# 4. Buildings

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for buildings and other constructions.

### 4.1 Vandalism

&#x20;If you destroy land just outside a city, this can also be seen as vandalism.

Exceptions are narrow pillars of low value. For example, a pillar of dirt, cobblestone, or sand.

Compensation for vandalism in nature. If the damage is done to unprotected land, the owner cannot expect to receive any compensation.

### 4.2 Unlawful engineering work

&#x20;Farm with ladders/vines: Using ladders/vines at edges in farms to prevent entity-cramming is prohibited.

Downward farm: It is okay to harvest all the downwards in a farm simultaneously using water buckets in a dispenser activated by a lever or a button.

### 4.4 Unlawful financial operations

&#x20;Interest is a concept that can be tricky to understand, especially if you are younger. We can easily say that there are two types of interest. Nominal interest and interest in the form of an origination fee. Nominal interest is prohibited, while an origination fee may be allowed. The different types are explained further below, and examples of what is allowed and not are at the end.

Nominal interest: It is a fee paid at regular intervals. Usually, it is a percentage of the remaining loan that is paid each time. The disadvantage of this type of interest is that it is unclear how much one has to pay back, as the cost of the loan increases over time. We have chosen to prohibit it because it can be difficult for everyone to understand.

Origination fee: It is a fixed one-time cost for the loan. The total amount repaid for the loan will not change over time. The origination fee mustn't be unreasonably high.

Examples of what is not allowed:

* You can borrow my pickaxe, and then you have to pay an extra 100mm each day until I get it back.
* You can borrow 1000mm if you pay back the same amount with a 100% interest daily.

Examples of what may be reasonable:

* You can borrow my pickaxe if you pay me 100mm and return it within a month.
* You can borrow 50,000mm if you repay the amount + 5000mm within a month.

### 4.5 Unlawful aircraft

&#x20;It is only allowed to build machines (aircraft) in controlled forms if they meet certain criteria:

* The machine must have stop blocks in the form of obsidian or furnaces at both start and stop.
* The machine may only be built on city land and on a plot intended for the machine.
* The entire path of the machine must be visible to the player (so one must be able to see the entire way between start and stop).
* The machine must not be able to change its flight direction, nor have the ability to do so with player involvement, for example, by pressing a button.

Moderators have the right at any time to dismantle a machine they believe may threaten any building on the server or otherwise go against the above guidelines. The moderator also has no obligation to return materials from a machine that is considered to violate the rule.

### 4.6 Redstone Rules

* Passive and Active redstone farms

Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone

* &#x20;Large scale redstone farms

Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

* Redstone machinery

Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.
