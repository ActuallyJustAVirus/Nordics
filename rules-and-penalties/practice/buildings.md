# Buildings

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for buildings and other constructions.

#### 4.1 Vandalism

&#x20;If you destroy land just outside a city, this can also be seen as vandalism.

Exceptions are narrow pillars of low value. For example, a pillar of dirt, cobblestone, or sand.

Compensation for vandalism in nature. If the damage is done to unprotected land, the owner cannot expect to receive any compensation.

#### 4.2 Unlawful engineering work

&#x20;Farm with ladders/vines: Using ladders/vines at edges in farms to prevent entity-cramming is prohibited.

Downward farm: It is okay to harvest all the downwards in a farm simultaneously using water buckets in a dispenser activated by a lever or a button.

Gold farm: Can be built, but a maximum of 8820 portal blocks may be used per farm (for example, 20 23x23 obsidian portals). Two farms must not be located close enough to be activated simultaneously by just one player. In practice, this means at least 100 blocks apart, preferably more.

Guardian farm: Can be built. But the floor must not consist solely of hoppers, and guardians must die immediately. It is not okay to collect them into a huge pile.

Turtle farms: If moderators find a farm/an area that does not follow the rule (10 within a 16x16 block area), the farm will be demolished, and the owner will receive no compensation. If the area is larger, the turtles must be able to move freely within the area.

Spider farms: Must not be designed solely for XP, meaning they must not be constructed so that spiders can be gathered in one place without dying "sooner or later". A suitable construction can, for example, be built on water and magma blocks. It is okay to collect XP by killing them yourself, but the spiders you do not kill must move on and die automatically.

Shulker farm: Does not work as breeding is disabled.

#### 4.4 Unlawful financial operations

&#x20;Interest is a concept that can be tricky to understand, especially if you are younger. We can easily say that there are two types of interest. Nominal interest and interest in the form of an origination fee. Nominal interest is prohibited, while an origination fee may be allowed. The different types are explained further below, and examples of what is allowed and not are at the end.

Nominal interest: It is a fee paid at regular intervals. Usually, it is a percentage of the remaining loan that is paid each time. The disadvantage of this type of interest is that it is unclear how much one has to pay back, as the cost of the loan increases over time. Because it can be difficult for everyone to understand, we have chosen to prohibit it entirely.

Origination fee: It is a fixed one-time cost for the loan. The total amount repaid for the loan will not change over time. It is important that the origination fee is not unreasonably high.

Examples of what is not allowed:

* You can borrow my pickaxe, and then you have to pay an extra 100mm for each day that goes by until I get it back.
* You can borrow 1000mm if you pay back the same amount with a 100% interest on a daily basis.

Examples of what may be reasonable:

* You can borrow my pickaxe if you pay me 100mm and return it within a month.
* You can borrow 50,000mm if you pay back the amount + 5000mm within a month.

#### 4.5 Unlawful aircraft

&#x20;It is only allowed to build machines (aircraft) in controlled forms if they meet certain criteria:

* The machine must have stop blocks in the form of obsidian or furnaces at both start and stop.
* The machine may only be built on city land and on a plot intended for the machine.
* The entire path of the machine must be visible to the player (so one must be able to see the entire way between start and stop).
* The machine must not be able to change its own flight direction, nor have the ability to do so with player involvement, for example, by pressing a button.

Moderators have the right at any time to dismantle a machine they believe may pose a threat to any building on the server or otherwise goes against the above guidelines. The moderator also has no obligation to return materials from a machine that is considered to violate the rule.
