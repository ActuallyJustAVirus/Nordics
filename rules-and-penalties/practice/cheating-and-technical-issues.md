&#x20;A page that provides more information about the rules in the cheating and technical issues section.

#### 1.1 Use of Cheating&#x20;

The rules state that anyone who uses any form of cheating, add-ons, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be judged for cheating. There are exceptions to this rule, and below is a list of modifications allowed to be used on the server.

List of allowed modifications and their guidelines:

* **Client mods:** Players are prohibited from using client mods known to cause server crashes or instability. Any client mods that have the potential to disrupt the server/player performance or cause crashes are strictly forbidden. Any concerns about specific mods should be brought to the attention of the server administrators for evaluation and approval before use.F
* Freecam mods are only allowed in matters of building, in terms of war, events and conflicts is not allowed. In terms of media and videos, you will need permission from moderators.

Performance-enhancing

* Optifine (including Shaders), BetterFPS Mod
* Fabulously Optimized (Some client)(excluding the use of analog controllers that this enables)

Armor and effect status

* Armor Status, Effect Status, HudPixel, 5zig 2.0

Maps

* Minimaps are allowed if they meet these requirements:
  * The map does not show other entities or players.
  * The map does not show underground caves.

Aids

* Schematica and Litematica (or equivalent)
  * It is allowed to use Schematica or Litematica, but only the "overlay" function. This means that only the blueprint is displayed as a hologram on the screen to see where blocks should be placed. All other functions, such as automatic or assisted placement, are considered cheating and will be penalized.

If you have a modification you want to use that is not on the list, ask first if it is okay to use. If we approve the modification, it will be added to the list.

1.3 Technical Issues List of bugs that are allowed to be used. The reason these bugs are allowed to be used may be because it is too difficult to control who is using them, or because they do not noticeably impact the server in a negative way.

* Block bug, placing blocks in a place where you cannot place blocks, and thus being able to jump on them in the air.
* Water bucket bug, placing water with a bucket in a place where you should not be able to, and thus being able to stand in non-existent water.
* Nether ceiling, it is not forbidden to get up on the ceiling (above level 128), but you die instantly because the area is declared as void.

1.4 Impersonator By generating mine coins, it means logging into new accounts to use the starting coins that account receives. This also applies to voting. For example, you are not allowed to vote with 3 different accounts and transfer the money from all 3 to your primary account.
