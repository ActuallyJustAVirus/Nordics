A page that provides more information about the rules in the behavior section.

#### 2.1 Fraud

&#x20;Agreements that severely disadvantage one party can also be seen as fraud. In some cases, players try to make agreements with one or more parties in such a way that one player severely exploits the other parties.

When making an agreement with another player, it is good to be clear, and it is important that both parties understand what the agreement entails. If an agreement is made with another player, it is also good to have it clearly documented, for example in the server's chat logs. Agreements that have only been made verbally, or on forums other than Kottcraft, are difficult to handle.

#### 2.2 Unlawful Killing&#x20;

There are cases where a player automatically accepts that they can be killed.

PvP arenas where there are clear markings about the rules inside the arena. At events where it is clearly marked/explained what applies and when.

#### 2.3 Theft

&#x20;Note that it also counts as theft to take over someone's constructions in nature. This is often referred to as "claiming" others' buildings.

If intentionally or accidentally picking up an item from the ground owned by someone else, one is obliged to return it if the owner wishes to have it back, even if the player lost the items in connection with a natural death. Refusing to return the items can lead to being convicted of theft.
