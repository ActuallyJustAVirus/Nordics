# Suspended indefinitely

In addition to being banned from Kottcraft due to rule violations, it is also possible to be suspended. There are some differences between being banned and being suspended, the most important of which are as follows:

* Bans always have an expiration date, while suspensions are in effect until they are manually removed.&#x20;
* A suspension is rarely based on violating any of Nordics rules.
* If one is banned, they can appeal once per ban in support. As a suspended player, one does not have the right to appeal, although in some cases, there may still be an opportunity to question the suspension.&#x20;
* &#x20;Other players cannot see if someone is suspended, while it is always possible to see if someone is banned using the /player command.&#x20;
* Bans are a type of penalty one can receive for committing rule violations, while suspensions are not considered a penalty.&#x20;
* As a suspended player, one cannot log in to the server. If one is banned, they can usually log in, but only to the prison cell they have been placed in.

#### Suspension due to inappropriate name

&#x20;Usually, suspensions are directed at individual player accounts, which means that one continues to be suspended even if they change the name on their account. In some cases, however, the name itself is considered inappropriate, not the account or the person who holds the account. If someone logs into the server with an inappropriate name, the name itself can be suspended. No account with that name can log in to the server, but the account itself is not suspended.

If one has been suspended due to their name, it is sufficient to log in to Mojang's website and change their name to something that is allowed, after which they can log in to the server again.
