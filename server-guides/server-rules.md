_What Are the Rules for the Nordics Minecraft Server?_&#x20;

While we don't have a formal list of rules, our core goal is to create a fair and respectful gaming environment for everyone. The following guidelines should answer most of your questions:

* :shield: **Fair Play**: Utilizing 'clever use of game mechanics' or manipulating in-game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage is not allowed.
* :no\_entry: **Monster Farms & AFK Fishing**: The use of monster farms and AFK fishing is completely prohibited, anywhere, on the server.
* :x:**No Cheating, Hacking or Duping**: Engaging in any form of cheating, hacking, duping, or exploiting vulnerabilities for an advantage will result in immediate action being taken.
* :handshake:**Respectful Conduct and Transparency**: Any form of derogatory or bigoted language is prohibited, as well as racism and homophobia. Additionally, players are not allowed to hide or change their in-game names in a manner that obscures their identity to others.
* :earth\_americas:**World Borders**: It is not permitted to build outside of, over, or under world borders. This rule also extends to the Nether, where players should not attempt to breach or build above or below the bedrock layers.
* :no\_pedestrians:**No World Griefing**: Avoid intentional large-scale environmental damage, like forest fires or lavacasting, as examples, to preserve the shared game world.
* Do not steal or grief active players
* :scroll:**Client mods:** Players are prohibited from using client mods that are known to cause server crashes or instability. Any client mods that have the potential to disrupt the server/player performance or cause crashes are strictly forbidden. Any concerns about specific mods should be brought to the attention of the server administrators for evaluation and approval before use.
*   #### Redstone Rules

    * Passive and Active redstone farms

    Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone

    * &#x20;Large scale redstone farms

    Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

    * Redstone machinery

    Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.

    *   &#x20;Unlawful flying machines \
        It is only allowed to build machines (flying machines) in controlled forms if they follow certain criteria:

        The machine must have stopping blocks in the form of obsidian or furnace at both start and stop. The machine may only be built on town land and on a plot intended for the machine. The entire route of the machine must be visible to the player (you must be able to see the entire path between start and stop). The machine must not be able to change its flight direction, nor have the ability to do so with player involvement, for example, by pressing a button.

        Moderators have the right at any time to dismantle a machine that they consider may pose a threat to any building on the server or otherwise violate the above guidelines. The moderator also has no obligation to return materials from a machine that is considered to violate the rule."
