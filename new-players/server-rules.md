      * Temporary allowance for stealing resources or items from opposing players or factions as part of the war effort.
      * Permission for limited manipulation of in-game assets, such as altering structures or terrain within the context of the war or conflict. (Admins may revert large changes, ex opposition setting towns, ships on fire)

It's important to establish clear guidelines and ensure that all involved players understand the boundaries and limitations of these exceptions.

*   #### Redstone Rules

    * Passive and Active redstone farms

    Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone

    * &#x20;Large scale redstone farms

    Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

    * Redstone machinery

    Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.
