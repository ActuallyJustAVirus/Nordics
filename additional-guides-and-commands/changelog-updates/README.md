# âš™ Patchnotes

Semantic versioning: Consider using semantic versioning, also known as SemVer, which consists of three numbers separated by dots (e.g., 1.2.3). These numbers represent major, minor, and patch versions, respectively.

* Major version (X.y.z): Increment the major version when you make incompatible API changes or introduce significant new features.
* Minor version (x.Y.z): Increment the minor version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
* Patch version (x.y.Z): Increment the patch version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
